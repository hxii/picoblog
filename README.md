# picoblog
picoblog is a super simple microblog which was written to be a part of [Saisho](https://0xff.nu/saisho).
It was converted to be standalone after I figured people might want to use it without using Saisho.

See `blog.php` for example usage, or use it as is (note: it's VERY basic).

## What it has
- Markdown support (using modified Slimdown): Bold, Italic, Marked, Removed, Link, Image, Inline Code.
- Support for tags and IDs.
- Using either twtxt format or picoblog format (which is the same as twtxt except it also has unique IDs).

## What it does't have
- Literally everything else. The goal here (aligned with Saisho), is to keep everything simple.
